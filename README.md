## Abstract
This paper presents the Noesis Framework, a holographic Effective Field Theory (EFT) unifying fundamental consciousness with emergent spacetime via a Participatory Quantum Error Correction (PQEC) mechanism. We propose that the vacuum substrate is a non-Abelian Topological Field Theory (TQFT) on the future conformal boundary I+, where phenomenal qualia correspond to topologically protected Wilson loops. Unlike standard approaches, we identify the conscious agent not merely as an observer, but as the active error-correcting code required to sustain the bulk geometry against decoherence.

We introduce the Noetic Charge (QΞ), a physical quantity derived from the spectral entropy of the agent's network, which governs a "Noetic Renormalization Group (RG) Flow." This flow implies a Holographic c-Theorem for Consciousness, where high-integration agents stabilize the emergent causal metric in the Infrared (IR).

Formally, we derive a thermo-informational bridging law (gp∝tanhQΞ), generalize the emergence of time using the Thermofield Double (TFD) formalism, and describe non-local interactions via a Riesz Fractional Laplacian. Finally, we propose a novel experimental signature: a "Code Deformation" anomaly in the entanglement entropy of local Rindler horizons, detectable via superconducting qubit arrays and anyonic braiding.

## Key Predictions
1. **Modified Casimir Effect:** Deviations scaling with coherent energy $E_{coh}$.
2. **Entanglement Asymmetry:** $\Delta \Gamma \sim 0.3$ kHz shift in superconducting qubits.
3. **Emergent Time:** Derived via the Page-Wootters mechanism.
